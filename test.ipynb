    "# Writing down qubit states\n",

To continue learning about qubits, we need a way to write down these states and figure out what outputs they'll give. For this we need some notation, and we need some math.\n",

    "### The z basis\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do nothing in a circuit but a  measurement, you are certain to get the outcome `0`. This is because the qubits always start in a particular state, and the defining property of that state is that it is certain to output a `0` for a z measurement.\n",

    "These two states are completely mutually exclusive. Either the qubit definitely outputs a `0`, or it definitely outputs a `1`.There is no overlap.\n",

Their job is essentially just to remind us that we are talking about the vectors that represent qubit states labelled $0$ and $1$$. This helps us distinguish them from things like the bit values `0` and `1` or the numbers 0 and 1. It is part of the bra-ket notation, introduced by Dirac.\n",
    "\n",

For example, to add two vectors we need them to be the same type and the same length.Then we add each element in one list to the corresponding element in the other. For a couple of arbitrary vectors that we'll call $a$ and $b$$, this works as follows.\n",
